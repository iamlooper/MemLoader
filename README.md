## Notes 📝

- This is a module, so you will need to flash it. It works on Magisk, KernelSU, and APatch.
- To open the menu of MemLoader, use `su -c memloader -m` in Termux or any other terminal emulator.
- Keep in mind that the kernel may evict loaded objects from RAM under aggressive RAM usage circumstances or if you are low on RAM.
- Locking objects into RAM does not increase power consumption. Instead, it decreases power consumption due to the reduction in I/O operations.
